##Diabetes Prediction Project

This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual developing diabetes based on various health-related features. Using machine learning algorithms, the goal is to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic.


Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:


Age: Age of the patient.

Gender: Gender of the patient.

Polyuria: Frequent urination (Yes/No).

Polydipsia: Excessive thirst (Yes/No).

Sudden Weight Loss: Sudden loss of weight (Yes/No).

Weakness: Physical weakness (Yes/No).

Polyphagia: Excessive hunger (Yes/No).

Genital Thrush: Genital infections (Yes/No).

Visual Blurring: Blurred vision (Yes/No).

Itching: Persistent itching (Yes/No).

Irritability: Irritable mood (Yes/No).

Delayed Healing: Slow healing of wounds (Yes/No).

Partial Paresis: Partial paralysis (Yes/No).

Muscle Stiffness: Muscle stiffness (Yes/No).

Alopecia: Hair loss (Yes/No).

Obesity: Body obesity (Yes/No).

Class: Outcome of the test, where 1 represents diabetic and 0 represents non-diabetic.

Objective
The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on the provided features. The project uses a machine learning model to classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., 'Yes' or 'No' for symptoms), and normalizing numerical features like age.

Model Selection: Experimenting with various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Tools and Libraries Used

Python: The programming language used to build the model.

Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data and model performance.

Results
The model is trained to predict diabetes with a high level of accuracy, providing valuable insights for early diabetes detection.
